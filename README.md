# ML-Stock_Predction_Using_Linear-Regression

I have created **Machine Learning Model With Linear Regression** for **Stock Price Predictions.**

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Plotly](), [Pandas](), [Seaborn](), [Matplotlib](), [Scipy](), and [Sklearn]() for **Data analysis and Model Development.**

I've created [Linear Regression Model]() and performed it onto different companies stock price data.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook]() for coding!

I obtained the Dataset from [Kaggle]().

# Stock Price Prediction

Predicting the stock market has been the bane and goal of investors since its inception. 
Every day billions of dollars are traded on the stock exchange, and behind every dollar is an investor hoping to make a profit in one way or another.

Entire companies rise and fall daily depending on market behaviour. 
If an investor is able to accurately predict market movements, he offers a tantalizing promise of wealth and influence.

# What I have done?

**I have done:**
  * Data Cleaning and Analysis,
  * Data Exploration,
  * Build a function to plot graph of any company stock closing price,**(Check Image Below)**
  * ![Image6](https://github.com/Anuragtsl/ML-Stock_Predction_Using_Linear-Regression/blob/main/images/6.png)
  * Build a Linear regression model for predicting prices,
  * Build a function to deploy model on different company's data for predicting prices.**(Check Image Below)**
